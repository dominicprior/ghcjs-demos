# ghcjs-demos

This project is for learning enough ghcjs to write graphics programs for the browser.

To get ghcjs working, I used stack in an Ubuntu 16 VM, and followed the instructions here: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/ghcjs/.  I followed the instructions very carefully, because a previous attempt (on an earlier Ubuntu) failed, possibly due to not having installed all the pre-requisites that are mentioned here: https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs

## hello4

The starting point for my first working example, hello4, was this: https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs-dom-hello.

To build hello4, I just run "stack build", and, to try it out, I view inside chromium the index.html from the hello.jsexe folder that "stack build" mentions.

The program responds to clicks in the window by drawing the text at that position.

It also now has a forever loop that moves the text back to a given position (because the loop is stateless).
